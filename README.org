* Ansible playbook for Scala
  
- Develop and run Scala code, without installing SBT or a JDK.
- Fork, and edit the docker-compose file to run multiple versions of JDK or SBT.
- Fork, and add your own docker file to switch to a different JDK.
 
Requires Ansible, Docker, and Fish shell (PRs accepted for other shells)

** Usage
Run playbook to install
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  ./site.yml
#+END_SRC

Run SBT just as if it we're installed on the system.

** System State

The installation creates or edits the following files and directories.
|-----------------------------+---------------------------------------|
| ~/.ivy2                     | dependency cache                      |
| ~/.sbt                      | SBT configuration                     |
| ~/.docker-compose/scala.yml | docker-compose file                   |

** Troubleshooting
 
Interactive shell
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  docker-compose -f ~/.docker-compose/scala.yml run -it /bin/bash
#+END_SRC
